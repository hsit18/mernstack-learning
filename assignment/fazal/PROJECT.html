                        <p>This project is made in My FINAL YEAR of College.We describe the Helmet which is made smart using the latest "ARDUINO TECHNOLOGIES".The thought of developing this project comes from social responsibility towards the society. As we can see many accidents occurring around us, there is a lot of loss of life. If accidents are one issue, lack of treatment in proper time is another reason for deaths. According to the same survey , nearly half the injured people die due to lack of treatment in proper time. So, a thought from taking responsibility of society came our project "SMART HELMET".</p>
